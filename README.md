# Procrastopug

## A millenial take on the classic to-do list

This java console application intends to motivate **procrastinators** into a better lifestyle through positive reinforcement, by rewarding the completion of tasks with an increase in a pug's happiness. Procrastopug rewards completion of *one-time* todo items with treats, and rewards *recurring* items (such as groceries, fitness, and mental wellness) with pet necessities such as food, walks, and attention. The user will have an option to procrastinate on these items, which takes a toll on procrastopug's happiness, thereby guilt-tripping the user into completing these items. 

Procrastopug is inspired by the tamagotchi franchise; in the early 2000's, users worked tirelessly to keep their beloved pets alive and content. Project Procrastopug aims to diminish procrastination by integrating positive habits with a loveable electronic pet that users wouldn't want to neglect. Also, the java swing GUI gives the app a 'vintage' look.

## Usage:
install and open an IDE of your choice. 
run the file ./src/main/ui/procrastopugGUI.java to open the app, and navigate with your mouse and keyboard. Enjoy!
